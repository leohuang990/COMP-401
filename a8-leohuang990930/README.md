# A8Submission

This is a submisison repository for A8. Your code should be in packages under the src directory like all of our other assignments. It does not have to be in the a8 package, you can organize your code and include whatever you need. However, the class a8.GameOfLife should be the starting class for your game. If you already have the game implemented, simply add the appropriate call to the main method of your starting class from inside a8.GameOfLife.
